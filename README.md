# EDA-using-Python-Jupyter-Notebook-
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, visual &amp; statistical exploration, and key survival insights.

Key Steps
Load Data – Import training and test datasets (train.csv and test.csv) into pandas DataFrames.

Initial Exploration – Use .info(), .describe(), and .value_counts() to understand column types, missing values, and basic distribution.

Data Cleaning – Handle missing values for Age, Fare, and Embarked using median/mode imputation.

Feature Engineering – Create new features such as:

FamilySize

IsAlone

Title (extracted from passenger names)

Age Groups

Fare Groups

Data Visualization – Use histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, pairplots, and heatmaps to investigate distributions and correlations.

Observation & Insights – Interpret visual & statistical findings to identify factors affecting survival.
